This service is one of three services designed for the DDoS Information Sharing Project. ISPs receive data about
attacking IP addresses from their own network by sending GET requests to the API. The data conforms to the data
distribution schema outlined in a separate repository (https://github.com/cablelabs/ddos-info-sharing).
