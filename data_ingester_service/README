This service is one of three services designed for the DDoS Information Sharing Project. ISPs submit data to this
service by sending POST requests to the API. The data send must conform to the ingest schema given in the file
"Data Ingester Payload Schema.json". The service saves incoming data to a database separate from CRITs. The database
name is "staging_crits_data", and data is stored in the "new_events" collection of this database.

Additional Setup:
Before loading the service with CRITs, "Data Ingester Payload Schema.json" should be copied to the /data directory and
be renamed 'Data-Ingester-Payload-Schema.json'. This is because part of the service looks for a file at the fixed
location '/data/Data-Ingester-Payload-Schema.json'.
