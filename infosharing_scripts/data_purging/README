File Descriptions:

clear_old_data.py: Python script to removes all entries in all collections of the "old_crits_data" database where data
is stored after purging. It is not meant to be used in production; it is useful for testing the purge script.

DataPurgerTest.py: Python script that tests data purge script to make sure it works correctly. It does so by storing
partial data before the purge, and checking the same objects again after the purge, if they should still be present.

duration_config.json: Configuration file that determines how far back to keep data, in terms of the number of days and
months from the day the script is run. An example may already be present, but the values of the fields can be changed.

OldDataPurger.py: Python file containing class that defines how to purge data.

purge_script.py: Main Python script that purges data. Uses class defined in OldDataPurger.py.
