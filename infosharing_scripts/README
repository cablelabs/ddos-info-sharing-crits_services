This directory simply contains useful scripts for the DDoS Information Sharing project.

Each sub-directory has different categories of scripts:

1. data_purging: Scripts for removing unwanted data from the database.
2. data_updating: Scripts that update one or more fields in documents in the database.
3. examples: Simple scripts for new users to see how each service works in action.
4. speed_tests: Various scripts for testing different ways of writing complex functions, seeing which versions are faster.
5. statistics_reporting: Scripts that aggregate information from the database and email it to users. Most of these will
be used in cron jobs that run on a daily or weekly basis.


Note: When using the scripts in the "statistics_reporting" directory, make sure to do the following:

1. Fill in the credentials in the file 'credentials.json' with the information for the email that will send reports.
2. If it's not already there, add a new subdirectory called "reports" within the "statistics_reporting" directory. This is where data gets saved before it is emailed to users.
