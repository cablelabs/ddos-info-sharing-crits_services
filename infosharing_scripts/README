This directory simply contains useful scripts for the DDoS Information Sharing project.

Note: When using the scripts in the "statistics_reporting" directory, make sure to do the following:

1. Fill in the credentials in the file 'credentials.json' with the information for the email that will send reports.
2. If it's not already there, add a new subdirectory called "reports" within the "statistics_reporting" directory. This is where data gets saved before it is emailed to users.
