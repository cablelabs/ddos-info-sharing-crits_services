This service is one of three services designed for the DDoS Information Sharing Project. The service performs analytics
on data received through the ingest service. It runs on a separate background process, and spawns additional processes
to analyze data in parallel. The service reads data from the "new_events" collection of the "staging_crits_data"
database. In addition, when it finds data for events that have already been submitted, it adds a new entry to the
"bad_events" collection of the same database.

Running the Service:
Start the service by running the script "start_analytics_service.sh". The script saves its output to the file
"nohup.out". Shutdown the service at any time by running the script "stop_analytics_service.sh".
Both scripts should be run from within the "data_analytics_service" directory.

Additional Setup:
Add the file "Paths.property" to this directory. The file should set the variable "pythonpath" to the path that will be
used when running the Python scripts. It should include both the main CRITs directory and the directory with all
packages required to run the scripts.
